# PyForgeDS 🔧🐍

**A Python Data Structure and Algorithms Library for Learning and Practice**

---

## 📚 About

**PyForgeDS** is a personal side project designed to help **learn, implement, and teach** data structures and algorithms using Python. I'm building this library as a way to **supplement my own journey** through learning DSA—by implementing everything from "scratch" to deepen my understanding.

At the same time, I want PyForgeDS to be a helpful resource for others who are learning too. It provides clean, well-documented, and easy-to-follow implementations that can serve as both a reference and a learning tool.

 I do plan on remaking this in the future in C++ for regular usage and speed improvements.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Learn and solidify knowledge of data structures and algorithms
- ✅ Provide easy-to-understand implementations in pure Python
- ✅ Help others explore DSA concepts through clean code and documentation
